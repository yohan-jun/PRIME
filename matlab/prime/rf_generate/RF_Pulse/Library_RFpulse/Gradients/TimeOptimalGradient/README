This is the code accompanyig the paper: M. Lustig, S-J Kim and J. M. Pauly "A Fast Method for Designing Time-Optimal Gradient Waveforms for Arbitrary k-Space Trajectories" 2006, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging.

Functions:
	minTimeGradient.m  - The main function, and implementation of the time-optimal gradient design.
	vdSpiralDesign.m   - A utility function to design spiral trajectories with variable densities.
	@complex3d         - A utility class that extends the notion of complex values to 3D. A workaround
			     to use minTimeGradient for 3D waveforms

Examples:
	example_trapezoid.m - designs a trapezoid gradient that corresponds to a line in k-space.
	example_spiral.m - an example of a dual density spiral design.
	example_circle.m - design of a circular trajectory
	example_rosette.m - example of a time-optimal rosette trajectory design.
